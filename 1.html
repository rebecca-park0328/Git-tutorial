  <h3>In The Library, students get to hide their heads</h3>
  <br>

   <p>Eye witness claimed a KISJ pupil, an elementary school student, who was a girl wearing big ribbons on her head covered her entire face with the bulky, and big book in the library which was about the ionization energy works, three days ago.
  She covered her face with the book to hide the fact that she was sleeping during the reading time.
  A book was held by her hand to cover her face.
  And her head was supported by her, she changed the axis from her head to her arm, not to fall with the other hand.
  These kinds of complications are not only happening to a young girl, who I mentioned in the previous content, that slept in the class.
  It is very pensive problem because over and over time flows like water, more and more students get to fall asleep in the school due to the lack of sleep.
  There were even two students who were right about to sleep in the social studies class, two days ago.
  It is indubitably important not to make sleeping problems get to have a serious relapse.</p>
